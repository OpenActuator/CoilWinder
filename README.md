# OpenCoilWinder (Version 1.2)

This is a Small Coil Winder Project.

1. Structures
 - Coil winder : Arduino Nano, Motors
 - Control SW : PC Software (GUI, Communication)
 - Communication : RS232C Serial Communication (suppored arduino)

2. Mechanical Parts
 - All structure parts were made by 3D Printer
 - You can get the structure parts in the "3D Design" directory.
 - The sturcutre parts were designed by FreeCAD (http://www.freecadweb.org).

3. Electronical Parts
 - Arduino Nano
 - Rotating Motor : 17HS2408, L9110 H-bridge
 - Slider Motor : Slider Motor, L9110 H-bridge
 - DC-DC Down Convertor : LM2596

4. Problems
 - Rotating Motor is not enough power to rotate a coil.
 - Guide Stage can't use because of centering and frictional force about a guide rotator.
 - To need making a control software only for this winder.
